# lab-deploy-web-app

This repository contains a lab project for deploying a web application. The main objectives are:

1. Run the web app in a container using Docker.
2. Automate basic tests before deployment.
3. Monitor the app's health with simple metrics.
4. Implement manual rollback when necessary.
5. Document the entire process for others.
